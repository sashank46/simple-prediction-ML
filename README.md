# Iris Flower Classification
## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their features using the well-known Iris dataset. The model is built using Python and leverages libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Installation
To get started,install the required packages.To install all the packages copy paste the given text below in the Terminal:

<!-- [ pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ] -->

## Usage
Run the following command to execute the model:
     [<!-- python iris_model.py -->]
The script will output the accuracy of the model, display a confusion matrix, and predict the species of a sample iris flower.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:

<!-- [Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width] -->

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:

<!-- [Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica] -->

## Model

This project utilizes a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The model is trained and evaluated using a train-test split approach.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix visualizes the model's performance in classifying the different species.
